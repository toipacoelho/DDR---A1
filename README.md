### Connectivity Performance of Multi-Hop Wireless Networks With Mobile Terminals

The aim is to conduct a simulation analysis of the connectivity performance of a multi-hop wireless network with  mobile  nodes (i.e., nodes moving around  over  time)

The simulation analysis aims are:
In ad hoc networks: for different radio range values, the  aim  is  to determine  the  minimum required  number  of  nodes to obtain an acceptable connectivity performance level of 99%.
In wireless mobile networks with Access Points (second part of the assignment): for different  radio range values and  different number  of  nodes, the  aim  is to determine  the required number  and  location  of  AP  nodes  required  to obtain an acceptable connectivity performance level of 99%
